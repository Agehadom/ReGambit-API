### Planning

1/26

Today was spent planning for the project. Initially as a team we had a stand-up in order review the project template, goals, wireframing, user stories and the ERD. This allowed use to create a culture of code, create a team relationship/responsibilities, and reviewed SCRUM/Agile framework.  Once a plan was established two teams of two, Henry/James(Team Alpha) & Julius/Conner(Team Charlie), who were assigned to begin creating the front-end and back-end. Team Alpha was able to create the front-end foundation that established a stable point for User creation. They also completed the initial styling that will give our application a unique and professional design and layout while maintaining functionality. Team Charlie focused on creating the database that the user would be calling on. This included creation of curl-scripts, authenticated/unauthenticated routes and creating the different models and schemas. To conclude the day, as a group we reviewed the final products of coding and merged them to the Master branch, first deployment completed.
